Modern React with Redux

Complete solutions for the entire course are at:

https://github.com/StephenGrider/redux-code

I am storing the completed course files in the path:

\Tech\Schools\Udemy\Modern React with Redux\

------------------------
When I resumed taking the course in February 2019, the entire course content had been refreshed so the ReduxSimpleStarter app was jettisonned in favor of the jsx app we created from scratch without the need to download and unzip any code.  I have therefore deleted it.
