/**
 * This component strictly defines how a search bar looks and how it responds to user interaction.  It does not contain code to actually conduct the search.
 * o Its appearance has a hardcoded label and an input field.
 * o Its behavior is to capture keystrokes typed in input field and invoke an onFormSubmit() method when the user presses the Enter key.
 * o The App component caller handles the search logic in a function local to it, and it passes that function as props.onSubmit to this component.
 * o When the user presses the Enter key, the callback function passed as props.onSubmit from the App component caller is executed.
